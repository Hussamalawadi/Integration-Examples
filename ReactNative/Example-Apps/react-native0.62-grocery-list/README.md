# React-Native Integration with Jscrambler

This Demo Application was forked from [React Native School - Grocery List](https://github.com/ReactNativeSchool/react-native-grocery-list).

This has a custom Java module as well as a custom C++ lib to exemplify the hability to call C++ code (using Java as intermediary) from JavaScript.
